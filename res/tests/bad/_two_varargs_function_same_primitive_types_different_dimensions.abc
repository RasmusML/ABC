// valid in java, but not in ABC, since ".." will never be a "perfect match" when looking for function overloads.
// we could make ".." a perfect match, if another function without varargs is also a perfect match, then just give an error similiar to java.
testX :: (a: .. any) -> [] any { return a; }
testX :: (a: .. [] any) -> [][] any { return a; }

main :: () {
  b: [] i8;
  c: [] any = testX(b, b);
